Dear Santa,
<p>
Sorry about troubling you, it's little difficult to write what I want in that small paper slot in our office. otherwise, it would be confusing you. 
I will clearly write them here with some useful links so you can easily find them.

I know Santa was really rich and kind enough to bring me an iPhone Xs, but I heard you are almost bankrupt due to political corruption in Sri Lanka.
Here are some small wishes from me...
(Please pick some to match your budget, pack them and put them under the tree. waiting for your gifts)

</p>
