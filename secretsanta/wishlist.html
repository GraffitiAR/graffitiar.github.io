Hi Santa,
Sorry about troubling you, it's little difficult to write what I want in that small paper slot in our office. otherwise, it would be confusing for you. 
I will clearly write them here with some useful links so you can easily find them.

I know Santa was really rich and kind enough to bring me an iPhone Xs, but I heard you are almost bankrupt due to political corruption in Sri Lanka.
Here are some small wishes from me...
